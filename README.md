# CODERS LIBRARY
This is a simple DJango-based website for a library system to showcase and checkout books to users.

# Five UX Planes

## Strategy

Users will want a clean and easily digestible site.<br>
Users will want every page to be consistent.<br>
Users will want the ability to login and logout.<br>
Users will want the ability to see what books are available.<br>
Users will want the option to search for specific books by criteria.<br>
Users will want to be able to request specific books if they are unavailable.<br>
Users will want to be able to learn more about available books.<br>
Users will want to be able to reserve books for collection.<br>
Users will want to be able to review books.<br>
Users will want to be able to read reviews left by other users.<br>
Users will want to remain on the book they are viewing after submitting a review.<br>

Admins will want to be able to view book requests.<br>
Admins will want to be able to moderate and approve or disapprove reviews.<br>
Admins will want to be able to mark a book as returned to make it available.<br>

## Scope

The site should be cleanly presented, with all information clearly presented.<br>
The site should allow users to login and logout.<br>
The site should easily present a list of all available books for users to view.<br>
The site should have search functionality to allow users to filter book results.<br>
The site should have a form request to allow users to request books be added.<br>
The site should create dynamic views for each book to present more details information when a user accesses them.<br>
The site should have a button to allow users to request a book be reserved for collection.<br>
The site should disable this button if the book is currently unavailable.<br>
The site should have a form to allow users to submit reviews.<br>
The site should display approved reviews to users.

## Structure

In order to fulfill the users wants from the Strategy plane and the plans from the Scope plane I created a flowchart to understand how site flow.<br>

I also created a Entity-Relationship Diagram to get a better idea of what I would need to construct to make the site function as required.<br>

### Main Scripts



#### Helper Scripts



## Skeleton

A wireframes was drawn up before any code was written to understand how to present information on the home page.<br>

## Surface

I wanted everything on the site to be presented cleanly.<br>

# Features

## Home
The site initially loads a view of the Home page which contains the name of the library and a brief "About Us" description.<br>
![Image of the Home page]()

## Books
The site will display a list of books in the library's database and display them to the user. The user will be able to search and filter to find the books they want.<br>

### Request-Form
The Books List page has a button to prompt a modal to fill a form to leave a request for a specific book to be added to the library.<br>
![Image of the Request Modal page]()

## Book-Details
The Books List contains more information about a book as well as shows any possible reviews the books may have been left by other users.<br>
![Image of the Detailed Book view page]()

### Reviews
This is simply an area of the Book-Details page which contains both a form to submit a review of a book as well as pre-existing and approved reviews.<br>

## Login-Form & Logout-Form
These are simple forms to allow users to login or logout of the site.<br>
